# Particle-System

Code written in C++.

Particle systems are used in games, movies, etc. to depict phenomena such as clouds, dust, fireworks, fire, explosions, water flow, sand, insects, wildebeests, etc. Once you know what they are, you can't stop seeing them.

To make a particle system work, you manipulate a collection of many 3D particles to exhibit some behavior.
